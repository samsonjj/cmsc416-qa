'George Washington' (February 22, 1732}} – , 1799) was an American political
leader, military general, statesman, and Founding Father who also served as the
first president of the United States from 1789 to 1797. He led Patriot forces to
victory in the nation's War of Independence, and he presided at the
Constitutional Convention of 1787 which established the new federal government.
He has been called the "Father of His Country" for his manifold leadership in
the formative days of the new nation.

Washington received his initial military training and command with the Virginia
Regiment during the French and Indian War. He was later elected to the Virginia
House of Burgesses and was named a delegate to the Continental Congress, where
he was appointed Commanding General of the nation's Continental Army. Washington
led American forces, allied with France, in the defeat of the British at
Yorktown. Once victory for the United States was in hand in 1783, Washington
resigned his commission.

Washington played a key role in the adoption and ratification of the
Constitution and was then elected president by the Electoral College in the
first two elections. He implemented a strong, well-financed national government
while remaining impartial in a fierce rivalry between cabinet members Thomas
Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton. During the French Revolution, he proclaimed a
policy of neutrality while sanctioning the Jay Treaty. He set enduring
precedents for the office of president, including the title "President of the
United States", and his Farewell Address is widely regarded as a pre-eminent
statement on republicanism.

Washington utilized slave labor, owning and trading African American slaves, but
he became troubled with the institution of slavery and freed them in his 1799
will. He was a member of the Anglican Church and the Freemasons, and he urged
tolerance for all religions in his roles as general and president. Upon his
death, he was eulogized as "first in war, first in peace, and first in the
hearts of his countrymen." He has been memorialized by monuments, art,
geographical locations, stamps, and currency, and many scholars and polls rank
him among the top American presidents.

'Donald John Trump' (born June 14, 1946) is the 45th and current president of
the United States. Before entering politics, he was a businessman and television
personality.

Trump was born and raised in the New York City borough of Queens and received an
economics degree from the Wharton School. He was appointed president of his
family's real estate business in 1971, renamed it The Trump Organization, and
expanded it from Queens and Brooklyn into Manhattan. The company built or
renovated skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. Trump later started
various side ventures, including licensing his name for real estate and consumer
products. He managed the company until his 2017 inauguration. He co-authored
several books, including [[Trump: The Art of the Deal|The Art of the Deal]]. He
owned the Miss Universe and Miss USA beauty pageants from 1996 to 2015, and he
produced and hosted [[The Apprentice (U.S. TV series)|The Apprentice]], a
reality television show, from 2003 to 2015. [[Forbes]] estimates his net worth
to be $3.1&nbsp;billion.

Trump entered the 2016 presidential race as a Republican and defeated sixteen
opponents in the primaries. His campaign received extensive free media coverage.
Commentators described his political positions as populist, protectionist, and
nationalist. Trump has made many false or misleading statements during his
campaign and presidency. The statements have been documented by fact-checkers,
and the media have widely described the phenomenon as unprecedented in American
politics. Trump was elected president in a surprise victory over Democratic
nominee Hillary Clinton. He became the oldest and wealthiest person ever to
assume the presidency, the first without prior military or government service,
and the fifth to have won the election despite having lost the popular vote. His
election and policies have sparked numerous protests. Many of his comments and
actions have been perceived as racially charged or racist.

During his presidency, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-
majority countries, citing security concerns; after legal challenges, the
Supreme Court upheld the policy's third revision. He enacted a tax cut package
for individuals and businesses, which also rescinded the individual health
insurance mandate and allowed oil drilling in the Arctic Refuge. He partially
repealed the Dodd-Frank Act that had imposed stricter constraints on banks in
the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. He has pursued his America First
agenda in foreign policy, withdrawing the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific
Partnership trade negotiations, the Paris Agreement on climate change, and the
Iran nuclear deal. He recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, imposed
import tariffs on various goods, triggering a trade war with China, and
negotiated with North Korea seeking denuclearization. He successfully nominated
two justices to the Supreme Court: Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.

The Justice Department investigated links between the Trump campaign and the
Russian government regarding its election interference. When Trump dismissed FBI
Director James Comey, who was in charge of the investigation, Deputy Attorney
General Rod Rosenstein appointed Robert Mueller as special counsel to proceed
with the probe. The Mueller investigation led to guilty pleas by five Trump
associates to criminal charges including lying to investigators, campaign
finance violations, and tax fraud. Trump repeatedly denied accusations of
collusion and obstruction of justice, calling the investigation a politically
motivated "witch hunt". Attorney General William Barr wrote that the special
counsel's final report did not find that Trump or his campaign had "conspired or
coordinated" with Russia during the 2016 election, but did not reach a
conclusion regarding obstruction of justice, neither implicating him regarding
obstruction of justice nor exonerating him.

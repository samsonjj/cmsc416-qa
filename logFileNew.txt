'George Washington' (February 22, 1732}} – , 1799) was an American political
leader, military general, statesman, and Founding Father who also served as the
first president of the United States from 1789 to 1797. He led Patriot forces to
victory in the nation's War of Independence, and he presided at the
Constitutional Convention of 1787 which established the new federal government.
He has been called the "Father of His Country" for his manifold leadership in
the formative days of the new nation.

Washington received his initial military training and command with the Virginia
Regiment during the French and Indian War. He was later elected to the Virginia
House of Burgesses and was named a delegate to the Continental Congress, where
he was appointed Commanding General of the nation's Continental Army. Washington
led American forces, allied with France, in the defeat of the British at
Yorktown. Once victory for the United States was in hand in 1783, Washington
resigned his commission.

Washington played a key role in the adoption and ratification of the
Constitution and was then elected president by the Electoral College in the
first two elections. He implemented a strong, well-financed national government
while remaining impartial in a fierce rivalry between cabinet members Thomas
Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton. During the French Revolution, he proclaimed a
policy of neutrality while sanctioning the Jay Treaty. He set enduring
precedents for the office of president, including the title "President of the
United States", and his Farewell Address is widely regarded as a pre-eminent
statement on republicanism.

Washington utilized slave labor, owning and trading African American slaves, but
he became troubled with the institution of slavery and freed them in his 1799
will. He was a member of the Anglican Church and the Freemasons, and he urged
tolerance for all religions in his roles as general and president. Upon his
death, he was eulogized as "first in war, first in peace, and first in the
hearts of his countrymen." He has been memorialized by monuments, art,
geographical locations, stamps, and currency, and many scholars and polls rank
him among the top American presidents.

'Donald John Trump' (born June 14, 1946) is the 45th and current president of
the United States. Before entering politics, he was a businessman and television
personality.

Trump was born and raised in the New York City borough of Queens and received an
economics degree from the Wharton School. He was appointed president of his
family's real estate business in 1971, renamed it The Trump Organization, and
expanded it from Queens and Brooklyn into Manhattan. The company built or
renovated skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. Trump later started
various side ventures, including licensing his name for real estate and consumer
products. He managed the company until his 2017 inauguration. He co-authored
several books, including [[Trump: The Art of the Deal|The Art of the Deal]]. He
owned the Miss Universe and Miss USA beauty pageants from 1996 to 2015, and he
produced and hosted [[The Apprentice (U.S. TV series)|The Apprentice]], a
reality television show, from 2003 to 2015. [[Forbes]] estimates his net worth
to be $3.1&nbsp;billion.

Trump entered the 2016 presidential race as a Republican and defeated sixteen
opponents in the primaries. His campaign received extensive free media coverage.
Commentators described his political positions as populist, protectionist, and
nationalist. Trump has made many false or misleading statements during his
campaign and presidency. The statements have been documented by fact-checkers,
and the media have widely described the phenomenon as unprecedented in American
politics. Trump was elected president in a surprise victory over Democratic
nominee Hillary Clinton. He became the oldest and wealthiest person ever to
assume the presidency, the first without prior military or government service,
and the fifth to have won the election despite having lost the popular vote. His
election and policies have sparked numerous protests. Many of his comments and
actions have been perceived as racially charged or racist.

During his presidency, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-
majority countries, citing security concerns; after legal challenges, the
Supreme Court upheld the policy's third revision. He enacted a tax cut package
for individuals and businesses, which also rescinded the individual health
insurance mandate and allowed oil drilling in the Arctic Refuge. He partially
repealed the Dodd-Frank Act that had imposed stricter constraints on banks in
the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. He has pursued his America First
agenda in foreign policy, withdrawing the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific
Partnership trade negotiations, the Paris Agreement on climate change, and the
Iran nuclear deal. He recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, imposed
import tariffs on various goods, triggering a trade war with China, and
negotiated with North Korea seeking denuclearization. He successfully nominated
two justices to the Supreme Court: Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.

The Justice Department investigated links between the Trump campaign and the
Russian government regarding its election interference. When Trump dismissed FBI
Director James Comey, who was in charge of the investigation, Deputy Attorney
General Rod Rosenstein appointed Robert Mueller as special counsel to proceed
with the probe. The Mueller investigation led to guilty pleas by five Trump
associates to criminal charges including lying to investigators, campaign
finance violations, and tax fraud. Trump repeatedly denied accusations of
collusion and obstruction of justice, calling the investigation a politically
motivated "witch hunt". Attorney General William Barr wrote that the special
counsel's final report did not find that Trump or his campaign had "conspired or
coordinated" with Russia during the 2016 election, but did not reach a
conclusion regarding obstruction of justice, neither implicating him regarding
obstruction of justice nor exonerating him.

}} 'SpongeBob SquarePants' is an American animated television series created by
marine science educator and animator Stephen Hillenburg for Nickelodeon. The
series chronicles the adventures and endeavors of the title character and his
various friends in the fictional underwater city of Bikini Bottom. The series'
popularity has made it a media franchise, as well as the highest rated series to
ever air on Nickelodeon, and the most distributed property of MTV Networks. As
of late 2017, the media franchise has generated $13 billion in merchandising
revenue for Nickelodeon.

Many of the ideas for the series originated in an unpublished educational comic
book titled The Intertidal Zone, which Hillenburg created in 1989. He began
developing SpongeBob SquarePants into a television series in 1996 upon the
cancellation of [[Rocko's Modern Life]], and turned to Tom Kenny, who had worked
with him on that series, to voice the title character. SpongeBob was originally
going to be named SpongeBoy, and the series was to be called SpongeBoy Ahoy!,
but both of these were changed, as the name was already trademarked.

Nickelodeon held a preview for the series in the United States on May 1, 1999,
following the television airing of the 1999 Kids' Choice Awards. The series
officially premiered on July 17, 1999. It has received worldwide critical
acclaim since its premiere and gained enormous popularity by its second season.
A feature film, [[The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie]], was released in theaters on
November 19, 2004, and was released on February 6, 2015. In 2018, the series
began airing its twelfth season.

The series has won a variety of awards, including six Annie Awards, eight
Golden Reel Awards, four Emmy Awards, 16 Kids' Choice Awards, and two BAFTA
Children's Awards. Despite its widespread popularity, the series has been
involved in several public controversies, including one centered on speculation

, 1399–1603]] This list of kings and queens of the Kingdom of England begins
with Alfred the Great, who initially ruled Wessex, one of the seven Anglo-Saxon
kingdoms which later made up modern England. Alfred styled himself King of the
Anglo-Saxons from about 886, and while he was not the first king to claim to
rule all of the English, his rule represents the start of the first unbroken
line of kings to rule the whole of England, the House of Wessex. petty kingdoms
to be unified as the early Kingdom of England]]

Arguments are made for a few different kings deemed to control enough Anglo-
Saxon kingdoms to be deemed the first king of England. For example, Offa of
Mercia and Egbert of Wessex are sometimes described as kings of England by
popular writers, but it is no longer the majority view of historians that their
wide dominions are part of a process leading to a unified England. Historian
Simon Keynes states, for example, that "Offa was driven by a lust for power, not
a vision of English unity; and what he left was a reputation, not a legacy."
This refers to a period in the late 8th century when Offa achieved a dominance
over many of the kingdoms of southern England, but this did not survive his
death in 796.

In 829 Egbert of Wessex conquered Mercia, but he soon lost control of it. It was
not until the late 9th century that one kingdom, Wessex, had become the dominant
Anglo-Saxon kingdom. Its king, Alfred the Great, was overlord of western Mercia
and used the title King of the Angles and Saxons, but he never ruled eastern and
northern England, which was then known as the Danelaw, having earlier been
conquered by the Danes from Scandinavia. His son Edward the Elder conquered the
eastern Danelaw, but Edward's son Æthelstan became the first king to rule the
whole of England when he conquered Northumbria in 927, and he is regarded by
some modern historians as the first true king of England. The title "King of the
English" or Rex Anglorum in Latin, was first used to describe Æthelstan in one
of his charters in 928.

The Principality of Wales was incorporated into the Kingdom of England under the
Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284, and in 1301 King Edward I invested his eldest son,
the future King Edward II, as Prince of Wales. Since that time, except for King
Edward III, the eldest sons of all English monarchs have borne this title.

After the death of Queen Elizabeth I without issue, in 1603, King James VI
of Scotland also became James I of England, joining the crowns of England
and Scotland in personal union. By royal proclamation, James styled himself
"King of Great Britain", but no such kingdom was actually created until
1707, when England and Scotland united to form the new Kingdom of Great
Britain, with a single British parliament sitting at Westminster, during the
reign of Queen Anne.

'Oprah Winfrey' (born 'Orpah Gail Winfrey'; January 29, 1954) is an American
media executive, actress, talk show host, television producer and
philanthropist. She is best known for her talk show [[The Oprah Winfrey Show]],
which was the highest-rated television program of its kind in history and was
nationally syndicated from 1986 to 2011 in Chicago. Dubbed the "Queen of All
Media", she was the richest African American of the 20th century and North
America's first black multi-billionaire, and has been ranked the greatest black
philanthropist in American history. She has also been sometimes ranked as the
most influential woman in the world.

Winfrey was born into poverty in rural Mississippi to a teenage single mother
and later raised in inner-city Milwaukee. She has stated that she was molested
during her childhood and early teens and became pregnant at 14; her son was born
prematurely and died in infancy. Winfrey was then sent to live with the man she
calls her father, Vernon Winfrey, a barber in Tennessee, and landed a job in
radio while still in high school. By 19, she was a co-anchor for the local
evening news. Winfrey's often emotional, extemporaneous delivery eventually led
to her transfer to the daytime talk show arena, and after boosting a third-rated
local Chicago talk show to first place, she launched her own production company
and became internationally syndicated.

Credited with creating a more intimate confessional form of media communication,
Winfrey popularized and revolutionized the tabloid talk show genre pioneered by
Phil Donahue. Through this medium, Winfrey broke 20th-century taboos and allowed
LGBT people to enter the mainstream through television appearances. In 1994, she
was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.

By the mid-1990s, Winfrey had reinvented her show with a focus on literature,
self-improvement, mindfulness and spirituality. Though she was criticized for
unleashing a confession culture, promoting controversial self-help ideas, and
having an emotion-centered approach, she has also been praised for overcoming
adversity to become a benefactor to others. Winfrey had also emerged as a
political force in the 2008 presidential race, delivering about one million
votes to Barack Obama in the razor close 2008 Democratic primary. In 2013,
Winfrey was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Obama and
honorary doctorate degrees from Duke and Harvard. In 2008, she formed her own
network, Oprah Winfrey Network.

'Central Park' is an urban park in Manhattan, New York City. It is located
between the Upper West Side and Upper East Side, roughly bounded by Fifth
Avenue on the east, Central Park West (Eighth Avenue) on the west, Central Park
South (59th Street) on the south, and Central Park North (110th Street) on the
north. Central Park is the most visited urban park in the United States, with
40 million visitors in 2013, and one of the most filmed locations in the world.
In terms of area, Central Park is the fifth largest park in New York City,
covering .

Central Park was first approved in 1853 as a . In 1857, landscape architect
Frederick Law Olmsted and architect/landscape designer Calvert Vaux won a design
competition to construct the park with a plan they titled the "Greensward Plan".
Construction began the same year, and the park's first areas were opened to the
public in late 1858. Additional land at the northern end of Central Park was
purchased in 1859, and the park was completed in 1873. After a period of decline
in the early 20th century, New York City parks commissioner Robert Moses started
a program to clean up Central Park. Another decline in the late 20th century
spurred the creation of the Central Park Conservancy in 1980, which refurbished
many parts of the park during the 1980s and 1990s.

Central Park was designated a National Historic Landmark by the U.S. Department

A 'bicycle', also called a 'cycle' or 'bike', is a human-powered or motor-
powered, pedal-driven, single-track vehicle, having two wheels attached to a
frame, one behind the other. A is called a cyclist, or bicyclist.

Bicycles were introduced in the late 19th century in Europe, and by the early
21st century, more than 1 billion were in existence at a given time. These
numbers far exceed the number of cars, both in total and ranked by the number of
individual models produced. They are the principal means of transportation in
many regions. They also provide a popular form of recreation, and have been
adapted for use as children's toys, general fitness, military and police
applications, courier services, bicycle racing and bicycle stunts.

The basic shape and configuration of a typical upright or "safety bicycle", has
changed little since the first chain-driven model was developed around 1885.
However, many details have been improved, especially since the advent of modern
materials and computer-aided design. These have allowed for a proliferation of
specialized designs for many types of cycling.

The bicycle's invention has had an enormous effect on society, both in terms of
culture and of advancing modern industrial methods. Several components that
eventually played a key role in the development of the automobile were initially
invented for use in the bicycle, including ball bearings, pneumatic tires, chain-
driven sprockets and tension-spoked wheels.Heitmann JA. The Automobile and
American Life. McFarland, 2009, , pp. 11ff

The traditional Christmas narrative, the Nativity of Jesus, delineated in the
New Testament says that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in accordance with
messianic prophecies. When Joseph and Mary arrived in the city, the inn had no
room and so they were offered a stable where the Christ Child was soon born,
with angels proclaiming this news to shepherds who then further disseminated the
information.

fourth century fixed the date as December 25.Corinna Laughlin, Michael R.

Gregorian calendar, which has been adopted almost universally in the civil
calendars used in countries throughout the world. However, some Eastern
Christian Churches celebrate Christmas on December 25 of the older Julian
calendar, which currently corresponds to a January date in the Gregorian
calendar. For Christians, the belief that God came into the world in the form of
man to atone for the sins of humanity, rather than the exact birth date, is
considered to be the primary purpose in celebrating Christmas.

mix of , Christian, and secular themes and origins. Popular modern customs of
the holiday include gift giving, completing an Advent calendar or Advent wreath,
Christmas music and caroling, lighting a Christingle, viewing a Nativity play,
an exchange of Christmas cards, church services, a special meal, pulling
Christmas crackers and the display of various Christmas decorations, including
Christmas trees, Christmas lights, nativity scenes, garlands, wreaths,
mistletoe, and holly. In addition, several closely related and often
interchangeable figures, known as Santa Claus, Father Christmas, Saint Nicholas,
and Christkind, are associated with bringing gifts to children during the
Christmas season and have their own body of traditions and lore. Because gift-
giving and many other aspects of the Christmas festival involve heightened
economic activity, the holiday has become a significant event and a key sales
period for retailers and businesses. The economic impact of Christmas has grown
steadily over the past few centuries in many regions of the world.

QUERY: |when is a leap year?|
KEYTERM: leap year
WIKI TEXT: 
A 'leap year' (also known as an 'intercalary year' or 'bissextile year') is a
calendar year containing one additional day (or, in the case of lunisolar
calendars, a month) added to keep the calendar year synchronized with the
astronomical or seasonal year. Because seasons and astronomical events do not
repeat in a whole number of days, calendars that have the same number of days in
each year drift over time with respect to the event that the year is supposed to
track. By inserting (also called [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalating]])
an additional day or month into the year, the drift can be corrected. A year
that is not a leap year is called a common year.

For example, in the Gregorian calendar, each leap year has 366 days instead of
365, by extending February to 29 days rather than the common 28. These extra
days occur in years which are multiples of four (with the exception of
centennial years not divisible by 400). Similarly, in the lunisolar Hebrew
calendar, Adar Aleph, a 13th lunar month, is added seven times every 19 years to
the twelve lunar months in its common years to keep its calendar year from
drifting through the seasons. In the Bah' Calendar, a leap day is added when
needed to ensure that the following year begins on the vernal equinox.

The name "leap year" probably comes from the fact that while a fixed date in the
Gregorian calendar normally advances one day of the week from one year to the
next, the day of the week in the 12 months following the leap day (from March 1
through February 28 of the following year) will advance two days due to the
extra day (thus "leaping over" one of the days in the week). For example,
Christmas Day (December 25) fell on a Sunday in 2016, Monday in 2017, and
Tuesday in 2018, then will fall on Wednesday in 2019 but then "leaps" over
Thursday to fall on a Friday in 2020.

The length of a day is also occasionally changed by the insertion of leap
seconds into Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), owing to the variability of
Earth's rotational period. Unlike leap days, leap seconds are not introduced on
a regular schedule, since the variability in the length of the day is not
entirely predictable.

reflecting the practice of the last night of eating rich, fatty foods before the
ritual fasting of the Lenten season.

Related popular practices are associated with Shrovetide celebrations before the
fasting and religious obligations associated with the penitential season of
Lent. In countries such as the United Kingdom, Mardi Gras is also known as
Shrove Tuesday, which is derived from the word shrive, meaning "to administer
the sacrament of confession to; to absolve".

The 'President of the United States' ('POTUS')}} is the head of state and head
of government of the United States of America. The president directs the
executive branch of the federal government and is the commander-in-chief of the
United States Armed Forces.

In contemporary times, the president is looked upon as one of the world's most
powerful political figures as the leader of the only remaining global
superpower. The role includes responsibility for the world's most expensive
military, which has the second largest nuclear arsenal. The president also leads
the nation with the largest economy by nominal GDP. The president possesses
significant domestic and international hard and soft power.

Article II of the Constitution establishes the executive branch of the federal
government. It vests the executive power of the United States in the president.
The power includes the execution and enforcement of federal law, alongside the
responsibility of appointing federal executive, diplomatic, regulatory and
judicial officers, and concluding treaties with foreign powers with the advice
and consent of the Senate. The president is further empowered to grant federal
pardons and reprieves, and to convene and adjourn either or both houses of
Congress under extraordinary circumstances. The president directs the foreign
and domestic policies of the United States, and takes an active role in
promoting his policy priorities to members of Congress. In addition, as part of
the system of checks and balances, of the Constitution gives the president the
power to sign or veto federal legislation. The power of the presidency has
grown substantially since its formation, as has the power of the federal
government as a whole.

Through the Electoral College, registered voters indirectly elect the president
and vice president to a four-year term. This is the only federal election in the
United States which is not decided by popular vote., The White House. Nine vice
presidents became president by virtue of a president's intra-term death or
resignation.

 sets three qualifications for holding the presidency: natural-born U.S.
 citizenship; at least thirty-five years of age; and residency in the United
 States for at least fourteen years. The Twenty-second Amendment precludes any
 person from being elected president to a third term. In all, 44 individuals
 have served 45 presidencies spanning 57 full four-year terms.. Grover Cleveland
 served two non-consecutive terms, so he is counted twice, as both the 22nd and
 24th president..

Donald Trump of New York is the 45th and current president of the United States.
He assumed office on January 20, 2017.

}} 'SpongeBob SquarePants' is an American animated television series created by
marine science educator and animator Stephen Hillenburg for Nickelodeon. The
series chronicles the adventures and endeavors of the title character and his
various friends in the fictional underwater city of Bikini Bottom. The series'
popularity has made it a media franchise, as well as the highest rated series to
ever air on Nickelodeon, and the most distributed property of MTV Networks. As
of late 2017, the media franchise has generated $13 billion in merchandising
revenue for Nickelodeon.

Many of the ideas for the series originated in an unpublished educational comic
book titled The Intertidal Zone, which Hillenburg created in 1989. He began
developing SpongeBob SquarePants into a television series in 1996 upon the
cancellation of [[Rocko's Modern Life]], and turned to Tom Kenny, who had worked
with him on that series, to voice the title character. SpongeBob was originally
going to be named SpongeBoy, and the series was to be called SpongeBoy Ahoy!,
but both of these were changed, as the name was already trademarked.

Nickelodeon held a preview for the series in the United States on May 1, 1999,
following the television airing of the 1999 Kids' Choice Awards. The series
officially premiered on July 17, 1999. It has received worldwide critical
acclaim since its premiere and gained enormous popularity by its second season.
A feature film, [[The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie]], was released in theaters on
November 19, 2004, and was released on February 6, 2015. In 2018, the series
began airing its twelfth season.

The series has won a variety of awards, including six Annie Awards, eight
Golden Reel Awards, four Emmy Awards, 16 Kids' Choice Awards, and two BAFTA
Children's Awards. Despite its widespread popularity, the series has been
involved in several public controversies, including one centered on speculation
over SpongeBob's intended sexual orientation. In 2011, a newly described
species of fungus, [[Spongiforma squarepantsii]], was named after the cartoon's
title character. A Broadway musical based on the series opened in 2017 to
critical acclaim.

On February 14, 2019, it was announced that a SpongeBob SquarePants spin-off is
in development.

'England' is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land
borders with Wales to the west and Scotland to the north-northwest. The Irish
Sea lies west of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is
separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English
Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great
Britain, which lies in the North Atlantic, and includes over 100 smaller
islands, such as the Isles of Scilly and the Isle of Wight.

The area now called England was first inhabited by modern humans during the
Upper Palaeolithic period, but takes its name from the Angles, a Germanic tribe
deriving its name from the Anglia peninsula, who settled during the 5th and 6th
centuries. England became a unified state in the 10th century, and since the Age
of Discovery, which began during the 15th century, has had a significant
cultural and legal impact on the wider world. The English language, the Anglican
Church, and English law – the basis for the common law legal systems of many
other countries around the world – developed in England, and the country's
parliamentary system of government has been widely adopted by other nations. The
Industrial Revolution began in 18th-century England, transforming its society
into the world's first industrialised nation.

England's terrain is chiefly low hills and plains, especially in central and
southern England. However, there is upland and mountainous terrain in the north
(for example, the Lake District and Pennines) and in the west (for example,
Dartmoor and the Shropshire Hills). The capital is London, which has the
largest metropolitan area in both the United Kingdom and the European
Union.According to the European Statistical Agency, London is the largest
Larger Urban Zone in the EU, a measure of metropolitan area which comprises a
city's urban core as well as its surrounding commuting zone. London's municipal
population is also the largest in the EU. England's population of over
55&nbsp;million comprises 84% of the population of the United Kingdom, largely
concentrated around London, the South East, and conurbations in the Midlands,
the North West, the North East, and Yorkshire, which each developed as major
industrial regions during the 19th
century.[http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171778_270487.pdf 2011 Census –
Population and household estimates for England and Wales, March 2011]. Accessed
31 May 2013.

The Kingdom of England – which after 1535 included Wales – ceased being a
separate sovereign state on 1 May 1707, when the Acts of Union put into effect
the terms agreed in the Treaty of Union the previous year, resulting in a
political union with the Kingdom of Scotland to create the Kingdom of Great
Britain.William E. Burns, A Brief History of Great Britain,

heritage/evolutionofparliament/legislativescrutiny/ Acts of Union 1707]
parliament.uk. Retrieved 27 January 2011 In 1801, Great Britain was united with
the Kingdom of Ireland (through another Act of Union) to become the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1922 the Irish Free State seceded from
the United Kingdom, leading to the latter being renamed the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

'Asia' () is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in
the Eastern and Northern Hemispheres. It shares the continental landmass of
Eurasia with the continent of Europe and the continental landmass of Afro-
Eurasia with both Europe and Africa. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of
Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The
continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population,,
[https://web.archive.org/web/20160101220025/http://www.un.org/esa/population/pu-
blications/sixbillion/sixbilpart1.pdf Table 2] was the site of many of the first
civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and
population, but also dense and large settlements, as well as vast barely
populated regions. Its 4.5 billion people () constitute roughly 60% of the
world's population.

In general terms, Asia is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, on the south
by the Indian Ocean, and on the north by the Arctic Ocean. The border of Asia
with Europe is a historical and cultural construct, as there is no clear
physical and geographical separation between them. It is somewhat arbitrary and
has moved since its first conception in classical antiquity. The division of
Eurasia into two continents reflects East–West cultural, linguistic, and ethnic
differences, some of which vary on a spectrum rather than with a sharp dividing
line. The most commonly accepted boundaries place Asia to the east of the Suez
Canal separating it from Africa; and to the east of the Turkish Straits, the
Ural Mountains and Ural River, and to the south of the Caucasus Mountains and
the Caspian and Black Seas, separating it from Europe. "Europe" (pp. 68–69);
"Asia" (pp. 90–91): "A commonly accepted division between Asia and Europe is
formed by the Ural Mountains, Ural River, Caspian Sea, Caucasus Mountains, and
the Black Sea with its outlets, the Bosporus and Dardanelles."

China and India alternated in being the largest economies in the world from 1 to
1800 CE. China was a major economic power and attracted many to the east, and
for many the legendary wealth and prosperity of the ancient culture of India
personified Asia,[http://www.indianscience.org/essays/22-%20E--
Gems%20&%20Minerals%20F.pdf] attracting European commerce, exploration and
colonialism. The accidental discovery of a trans-Atlantic route from Europe to
America by Columbus while in search for a route to India demonstrates this deep
fascination. The Silk Road became the main east–west trading route in the Asian
hinterlands while the Straits of Malacca stood as a major sea route. Asia has
exhibited economic dynamism (particularly East Asia) as well as robust
population growth during the 20th century, but overall population growth has
since fallen.. Asia was the birthplace of most of the world's mainstream
religions including Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Jainism, Buddhism,
Confucianism, Taoism, Christianity, Islam, Sikhism, as well as many other
religions.

Given its size and diversity, the concept of Asia—a name dating back to
classical antiquity—may actually have more to do with human geography than
physical geography. Asia varies greatly across and within its regions with
regard to ethnic groups, cultures, environments, economics, historical ties
and government systems. It also has a mix of many different climates ranging
from the equatorial south via the hot desert in the Middle East, temperate
areas in the east and the continental centre to vast subarctic and polar areas
in Siberia.

The 'Eiffel Tower' ( ; ) is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in
Paris, France. It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company
designed and built the tower.

Constructed from 1887 to 1889 as the entrance to the 1889 World's Fair, it was
initially criticised by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for
its design, but it has become a global cultural icon of France and one of the
most recognisable structures in the world. The Eiffel Tower is the most-visited
paid monument in the world; 6.91&nbsp;million people ascended it in 2015.

The tower is tall, about the same height as an 81- building, and the tallest
structure in Paris. Its base is square, measuring on each side. During its
construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become the
tallest man-made structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years until the
Chrysler Building in New York City was finished in 1930. Due to the addition of
a broadcasting aerial at the top of the tower in 1957, it is now taller than the
Chrysler Building by . Excluding transmitters, the Eiffel Tower is the second
tallest free-standing structure in France after the Millau Viaduct.

The tower has three levels for visitors, with restaurants on the first and
second levels. The top level's upper platform is above the ground – the highest
observation deck accessible to the public in the European Union. Tickets can be
purchased to ascend by stairs or lift to the first and second levels. The climb
from ground level to the first level is over 300 steps, as is the climb from the
first level to the second. Although there is a staircase to the top level, it is
usually accessible only by lift.

The 'Leaning Tower of Pisa' () or simply the 'Tower of Pisa' (Torre di Pisa ) is
the [[campanile]], or freestanding bell tower, of the cathedral of the Italian
city of Pisa, known worldwide for its nearly four-degree lean, the result of an
unstable foundation. The tower is situated behind the Pisa Cathedral and is the
third oldest structure in the city's Cathedral Square ([[Piazza del Duomo,
Pisa|Piazza del Duomo]]), after the cathedral and the Pisa Baptistry.

The tower's tilt began during construction in the 12th century, due to soft
ground on one side, which was unable to properly support the structure's weight.
The tilt increased in the decades before the structure was completed in the 14th
century. It gradually increased until the structure was stabilized (and the tilt
partially corrected) by efforts in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.

The height of the tower is from the ground on the low side and on the high side.
The width of the walls at the base is . Its weight is estimated at . The tower
has 296 or 294 steps; the seventh floor has two fewer steps on the north-facing
staircase. In 1990 the tower leaned at an angle of 5.5 degrees, but following

The 'Himalayas', or 'Himalaya' (), form a mountain range in Asia, separating the
plains of the Indian subcontinent from the Tibetan Plateau. The range has many
of the Earth's highest peaks, including the highest, Mount Everest. The
Himalayas include over fifty mountains exceeding in elevation, including ten of
the fourteen 8,000-metre peaks. By contrast, the highest peak outside Asia
(Aconcagua, in the Andes) is tall.

Lifted by the subduction of the Indian tectonic plate under the Eurasian Plate,
the Himalayan mountain range runs west-northwest to east-southeast in an arc
long. Its western anchor, Nanga Parbat, lies just south of the northernmost bend
of Indus river. Its eastern anchor, Namcha Barwa, is just west of the great bend
of the Yarlung Tsangpo River (upper stream of the Brahmaputra River). The
Himalayan range is bordered on the northwest by the Karakoram and the Hindu Kush
ranges. To the north, the chain is separated from the Tibetan Plateau by a wide
tectonic valley called the Indus-Tsangpo Suture. Towards the south the arc of
the Himalaya is ringed by the very low Indo-Gangetic Plain. 275A: 1–44. The
range varies in width from in the west (Pakistan) to in the east (Arunachal
Pradesh). The Himalayas are distinct from the other great ranges of central
Asia, although sometimes the term 'Himalaya' (or 'Greater Himalaya') is loosely
used to include the Karakoram and some of the other ranges.

The Himalayas are inhabited by 52.7&nbsp;million people,Apollo, M. (2017). [htt-

five countries: Nepal, India, Bhutan, China and Pakistan. Some of the world's
major rivers – the Indus, the Ganges and the Tsangpo-Brahmaputra – rise in the
Himalayas, and their combined drainage basin is home to roughly 600 million
people. The Himalayas have a profound effect on the climate of the region,
helping to keep the monsoon rains on the Indian plain and limiting rainfall on
the Tibetan plateau. The Himalayas have profoundly shaped the cultures of the
Indian subcontinent; many Himalayan peaks are sacred in Hinduism and Buddhism.

'Kenya' (; ), officially the 'Republic of Kenya' (), is a country in Africa with
47 semiautonomous counties governed by elected governors. At , Kenya is the
world's 48th largest country by total area. With a population of more than 52.2
million people, Kenya is the 27th most populous country. Kenya's capital and
largest city is Nairobi while its oldest city and first capital is the coastal
city of Mombasa. Kisumu City is the third largest city and a critical inland
port at Lake Victoria. Other important urban centres include Nakuru and Eldoret.

Nilotic-speaking pastoralists (ancestral to Kenya's Nilotic speakers) started
migrating from present-day Southern Sudan into Kenya around 500 BC. European
colonisation of Kenya began in the 19th century during the European exploration
of the interior. The modern-day Kenya emerged from a protectorate established by
the British Empire in 1895 and the subsequent Kenya Colony, which began in 1920.
Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colony led to the Mau Mau
revolution, which began in 1952, and the subsequent declaration of independence
in 1963. After independence, Kenya remained a member of the Commonwealth of
Nations. The current constitution was adopted in 2010 to replace the 1963
independence constitution.

Kenya is a presidential representative democratic republic, in which elected
officials represent the people and the president is the head of state and
government. Kenya is a member of United Nations, World Bank, International
Monetary Fund, COMESA, and other international organisations. With a GNI of

'Mount Everest', known in Nepali as 'Sagarmatha' () and in Tibetan as
'Chomolungma' (), is Earth's highest mountain above sea level, located in the
Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas. The international border between
Nepal (Province No. 1) and China (Tibet Autonomous Region) runs across its
summit point.

The current official elevation of , recognized by China and Nepal, was
established by a 1955 Indian survey and subsequently confirmed by a Chinese
survey in 1975. In 2005, China remeasured the rock height of the mountain, with
a result of 8844.43 m (29,017 ft). There followed an argument between China and
Nepal as to whether the official height should be the rock height (8,844 m,
China) or the snow height (8,848 m, Nepal). In 2010, an agreement was reached by
both sides that the height of Everest is 8,848 m, and Nepal recognizes China's
claim that the rock height of Everest is 8,844 m.

In 1865, Everest was given its official English name by the Royal Geographical
Society, upon a recommendation by Andrew Waugh, the British . As there appeared
to be several different local names, Waugh chose to name the mountain after his
predecessor in the post, Sir George Everest, despite Everest's objections.

Mount Everest attracts many climbers, some of them highly experienced
mountaineers. There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit
from the southeast in Nepal (known as the "standard route") and the other from
the north in Tibet. While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges
on the standard route, Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness,
weather, and wind, as well as significant hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu
Icefall. , nearly 300 people have died on Everest, many of whose bodies remain
on the mountain.

The first recorded efforts to reach Everest's summit were made by British
mountaineers. As Nepal did not allow foreigners into the country at the time,
the British made several attempts on the north ridge route from the Tibetan
side. After the first reconnaissance expedition by the British in 1921 reached
on the North Col, the 1922 expedition pushed the north ridge route up to ,
marking the first time a human had climbed above . Seven porters were killed in
an avalanche on the descent from the North Col. The 1924 expedition resulted in
one of the greatest mysteries on Everest to this day: George Mallory and Andrew
Irvine made a final summit attempt on 8 June but never returned, sparking debate
as to whether or not they were the first to reach the top. They had been spotted
high on the mountain that day but disappeared in the clouds, never to be seen
again, until Mallory's body was found in 1999 at on the north face. Tenzing
Norgay and Edmund Hillary made the first official ascent of Everest in 1953,
using the southeast ridge route. Norgay had reached the previous year as a
member of the 1952 Swiss expedition. The Chinese mountaineering team of Wang
Fuzhou, Gonpo, and Qu Yinhua made the first reported ascent of the peak from the
north ridge on 25 May 1960.

'Paris' () is the capital and most populous city of France, with an area of and
an official estimated population of 2,140,526 residents as of 1 January 2019.
Since the 17th century, Paris has been one of Europe's major centres of finance,
diplomacy, commerce, fashion, science, and the arts.

The City of Paris is the centre and seat of government of the Île-de-France, or
Paris Region, which has an estimated official 2019 population of 12,213,364, or
about 18 percent of the population of France. The Paris Region had a GDP of €681
billion (US$850 billion) in 2016, accounting for 31 percent of the GDP of
France, and was the 5th largest region by GDP in the world. According to the
Economist Intelligence Unit Worldwide Cost of Living Survey in 2018, Paris was
the second most expensive city in the world, after Singapore, and ahead of
Zurich, Hong Kong, Oslo and Geneva.Economist Intelligence Unit Worldwide Cost of
Living Survey, 2018, cited in the London Telegraph, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/city-breaks/most-expensive-and-cheapest-

paris-le-trio-des-villes-les-plus-cheres-du-monde International mail.com].

The city is a major rail, highway, and air-transport hub served by two
international airports: Paris-Charles de Gaulle (the second busiest airport in
Europe) and Paris-Orly. Opened in 1900, the city's subway system, the Paris
Métro, serves 5.23 million passengers daily, and is the second busiest metro
system in Europe after Moscow Metro. Gare du Nord is the 24th busiest railway
station in the world, and the first located outside Japan, with 262 million
passengers in 2015.

Paris is especially known for its museums and architectural landmarks: the
Louvre was the most visited art museum in the world in 2018, with 10.2 million
visitors.The Art Newspaper Review Visitor Figures Survey for 2017 (April, 2018)
The Musée d'Orsay and Musée de l'Orangerie are noted for their collections of
French Impressionist art, and the Pompidou Centre Musée National d'Art Moderne
has the largest collection of modern and contemporary art in Europe. The
historical district along the Seine in the city centre is classified as a UNESCO
Heritage Site. Popular landmarks in the centre of the city include the Cathedral
of Notre Dame de Paris and the Gothic royal chapel of Sainte-Chapelle, both on
the Île de la Cité; the Eiffel Tower, constructed for the Paris Universal
Exposition of 1889; the Grand Palais and Petit Palais, built for the Paris
Universal Exposition of 1900; the Arc de Triomphe on the Champs-Élysées, and the
Basilica of Sacré-Coeur on the hill of Montmartre. Paris received 23 million
visitors in 2017, measured by hotel stays, with the largest numbers of foreign
visitors coming from the United States, the UK, Germany and China.Key Figures:

Spanish: Gran Cañón) is a steep-sided canyon carved by the Colorado River in
Arizona, United States. The Grand Canyon is long, up to wide and attains a
depth of over a mile ().

The canyon and adjacent rim are contained within Grand Canyon National Park, the
Kaibab National Forest, Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument, the Hualapai
Indian Reservation, the Havasupai Indian Reservation and the Navajo Nation.
President Theodore Roosevelt was a major proponent of preservation of the Grand
Canyon area, and visited it on numerous occasions to hunt and enjoy the scenery.

Nearly two billion years of Earth's geological history have been exposed as the
Colorado River and its tributaries cut their channels through layer after layer
of rock while the Colorado Plateau was
uplifted.[http://www.nps.gov/grca/naturescience/geologicformations.htm Geologic
Formations of the Grand Canyon] National Park Service Retrieved November 17,
2009 While some aspects about the history of incision of the canyon are debated
by geologists, several recent studies support the hypothesis that the Colorado
River established its course through the area about 5 to 6 million years ago.
Since that time, the Colorado River has driven the down-cutting of the
tributaries and retreat of the cliffs, simultaneously deepening and widening
the canyon.

For thousands of years, the area has been continuously inhabited by Native
Americans, who built settlements within the canyon and its many caves. The
Pueblo people considered the Grand Canyon a holy site, and made pilgrimages to
it. The first European known to have viewed the Grand Canyon was García López de
Cárdenas from Spain, who arrived in 1540.

The 'Appalachian Mountains', , , , .}}, often called 'the Appalachians', are a
system of mountains in eastern North America. The Appalachians first formed
roughly 480 million years ago during the Ordovician Period. They once reached
elevations similar to those of the Alps and the Rocky Mountains before
experiencing natural erosion. The Appalachian chain is a barrier to east–west
travel, as it forms a series of alternating ridgelines and valleys oriented in
opposition to most highways and railroads running east–west.

Definitions vary on the precise boundaries of the Appalachians. The United
States Geological Survey (USGS) defines the Appalachian Highlands physiographic
division as consisting of thirteen provinces: the Atlantic Coast Uplands,
Eastern Newfoundland Atlantic, Maritime Acadian Highlands, Maritime Plain, Notre
Dame and Mégantic Mountains, Western Newfoundland Mountains, Piedmont, Blue
Ridge, Valley and Ridge, Saint Lawrence Valley, Appalachian Plateaus, New
England province, and the Adirondack areas.{{cite web |title=Physiographic

WIKI TEXT: 



'', one of Post-Impressionist Paul Gauguin's most famous paintings]]

The 'meaning of life', or the 'answer to the question "What is the meaning of
life?"', pertains to the significance of living or existence in general. Many
other related questions include: "Why are we here?", "What is life all about?",
or "What is the purpose of existence?" There have been a large number of
proposed answers to these questions from many different cultural and
ideological backgrounds. The search for life's meaning has produced much
philosophical, scientific, theological, and metaphysical speculation throughout
history. Different people and cultures believe different things for the answer
to this question.

The meaning of life as we perceive it is derived from philosophical and
religious contemplation of, and scientific inquiries about existence, social
ties, consciousness, and happiness. Many other issues are also involved, such as
symbolic meaning, ontology, value, purpose, ethics, good and evil, free will,
the existence of one or multiple gods, conceptions of God, the soul, and the
afterlife. Scientific contributions focus primarily on describing related
empirical facts about the universe, exploring the context and parameters
concerning the "how" of life. Science also studies and can provide
recommendations for the pursuit of well-being and a related conception of
morality. An alternative, humanistic approach poses the question, "What is the
meaning of my life?"

QUERY: |what is love?|
KEYTERM: love
WIKI TEXT: 








'Love' encompasses a range of strong and positive emotional and mental states,
from the most sublime virtue or good habit, the deepest interpersonal affection
and to the simplest pleasure. An example of this range of meanings is that the
love of a mother differs from the love of a spouse, which differs from the love
of food. Most commonly, love refers to a feeling of strong attraction and
emotional attachment.Oxford Illustrated American Dictionary (1998) Merriam-
Webster Collegiate Dictionary (2000)

Love is also considered to be a virtue representing human kindness, compassion,
and affection, as "the unselfish loyal and benevolent concern for the good of
another". It may also describe compassionate and affectionate actions towards
other humans, one's self or animals.Fromm, Erich; The Art of Loving, Harper
Perennial (1956), Original English Version,

Love in its various forms acts as a major facilitator of interpersonal
relationships and, owing to its central psychological importance, is one of the
most common themes in the creative arts. Love has been postulated to be a
function to keep human beings together against menaces and to facilitate the
continuation of the species.Helen Fisher. Why We Love: the nature and chemistry
of romantic love. 2004.

Ancient Greek philosophers identified five forms of love: essentially, familial
love (in Greek, {{lang|grc-Latn|[[Storge]]}}), friendly love or platonic love
({{lang|grc-Latn|[[Philia]]}}), romantic love (), guest love () and divine love
(). Modern authors have distinguished further varieties of love: unrequited
love, infatuated love, self-love, and courtly love. Asian cultures have also
distinguished {{lang|zh-Latn|[[Ren (Confucianism)|Ren]]}}, {{lang|sa-
Latn|[[Kama]]}}, {{lang|sa-Latn|[[Bhakti]]}}, {{lang|sa-Latn|[[Mettā]]}}, {{lang|ar-
Latn|[[Ishq]]}}, {{lang|he-Latn|[[Chesed]]}}, and other variants or symbioses of
these states.Liddell and Scott: [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=P-
erseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dfili%2Fa φιλία] (J. Mascaró, translator)
Love has additional religious or spiritual meaning. This diversity of uses and
meanings combined with the complexity of the feelings involved makes love
unusually difficult to consistently define, compared to other emotional states.

QUERY: |what is the scientific method?|
KEYTERM: scientific method
WIKI TEXT: 






 with David Deutsch, proponent of invariant scientific explanations. See [[#DNA
 example| DNA example]] below.]]

The 'scientific method' is an empirical method of acquiring knowledge that has
characterized the development of science since at least the 17th century. It
involves careful observation, applying rigorous skepticism about what is
observed, given that cognitive assumptions can distort how one interprets the
observation. It involves formulating hypotheses, via induction, based on such
observations; experimental and measurement-based testing of deductions drawn
from the hypotheses; and refinement (or elimination) of the hypotheses based on
the experimental findings. These are principles of the scientific method, as
distinguished from a definitive series of steps applicable to all scientific
enterprises.

Though diverse models for the scientific method are available, there is in
general a continuous 'process' that includes observations about the natural
world. People are naturally inquisitive, so they often come up with questions
about things they see or hear, and they often develop ideas or hypotheses about
why things are the way they are. The best hypotheses lead to predictions that
can be tested in various ways. The most conclusive testing of hypotheses comes
from reasoning based on carefully controlled experimental data. Depending on how
well additional tests match the predictions, the original hypothesis may require
refinement, alteration, expansion or even rejection. If a particular hypothesis
becomes very well supported, a general theory may be developed.

Although procedures vary from one field of inquiry to another, they are
frequently the same from one to another. The process of the scientific method
involves making conjectures (hypotheses), deriving predictions from them as
logical consequences, and then carrying out experiments or empirical
observations based on those predictions.See, for example, . His thought
experiments disprove Aristotle's physics of falling bodies, in [[Two New
Sciences]]. A hypothesis is a conjecture, based on knowledge obtained while
seeking answers to the question. The hypothesis might be very specific, or it
might be broad. Scientists then test hypotheses by conducting experiments or
studies. A scientific hypothesis must be falsifiable, implying that it is
possible to identify a possible outcome of an experiment or observation that
conflicts with predictions deduced from the hypothesis; otherwise, the
hypothesis cannot be meaningfully tested.

The purpose of an experiment is to determine whether observations agree with or
conflict with the predictions derived from a hypothesis.Karl R. Popper,
Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge, Routledge, 2003
Experiments can take place anywhere from a garage to CERN's Large Hadron
Collider. There are difficulties in a formulaic statement of method, however.
Though the scientific method is often presented as a fixed sequence of steps, it
represents rather a set of general principles. Not all steps take place in every
scientific inquiry (nor to the same degree), and they are not always in the same
order.William Whewell, History of Inductive Science (1837), and in Philosophy of
Inductive Science (1840) Some philosophers and scientists have argued that there
is no scientific method; they include physicist Lee Smolin and philosopher Paul
Feyerabend (in his [[Against Method]]). Robert Nola and Howard Sankey remark
that "For some, the whole idea of a theory of scientific method is yester-year's
debate, the continuation of which can be summed up as yet more of the proverbial
deceased equine castigation. We beg to differ."

QUERY: |what is a mouse?|
KEYTERM: mouse
WIKI TEXT: 




 (Mus musculus)]] A 'mouse', plural 'mice', is a small rodent characteristically
 having a pointed snout, small rounded ears, a body-length scaly tail and a high
 breeding rate. The best known mouse species is the common house mouse (Mus
 musculus). It is also a popular pet. In some places, certain kinds of field
 mice are locally common. They are known to invade homes for food and shelter.

Species of mice are mostly found in Rodentia, and are present throughout the
order. Typical mice are found in the genus Mus.

Mice are typically distinguished from rats by their size. Generally, when
someone discovers a smaller muroid rodent, its common name includes the term
mouse, while if it is larger, the name includes the term rat. Common terms rat
and mouse are not taxonomically specific. Scientifically, the term mouse is not
confined to members of Mus for example, the deer mouse.

Domestic mice sold as pets often differ substantially in size from the common
house mouse. This is attributable both to breeding and to different conditions
in the wild. The best-known strain, the white lab mouse, has more uniform traits
that are appropriate to its use in research.

Cats, wild dogs, foxes, birds of prey, snakes and even certain kinds of
arthropods have been known to prey heavily upon mice. Nevertheless, because of
its remarkable adaptability to almost any environment, the mouse is one of the
most successful mammalian genera living on Earth today.

Mice, in certain contexts, can be considered vermin which are a major source of
crop damage, causing structural damage and spreading diseases through their
parasites and feces. In North America, breathing dust that has come in contact
with mouse excrement has been linked to hantavirus, which may lead to hantavirus
pulmonary syndrome (HPS).

Primarily nocturnal animals, mice compensate for their poor eyesight with a keen
sense of hearing, and rely especially on their sense of smell to locate food and
avoid predators.

Mice build long intricate burrows in the wild. These typically have long
entrances and are equipped with escape tunnels or routes. In at least one
species, the architectural design of a burrow is a genetic trait.

}} The 'horse' (Equus ferus caballus) is one of two extant subspecies of ''Equus
ferus''. It is an odd-toed ungulate mammal belonging to the taxonomic family
Equidae. The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55&nbsp;million years from a
small multi-toed creature, [[Eohippus]], into the large, single-toed animal of
today. Humans began domesticating horses around 4000 BC, and their domestication
is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC. Horses in the subspecies
caballus are domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the
wild as feral horses. These feral populations are not true wild horses, as this
term is used to describe horses that have never been domesticated, such as the
endangered Przewalski's horse, a separate subspecies, and the only remaining
true wild horse. There is an extensive, specialized vocabulary used to describe
equine-related concepts, covering everything from anatomy to life stages, size,
colors, markings, breeds, locomotion, and behavior.

Horses' anatomy enables them to make use of speed to escape predators and they
have a well-developed sense of balance and a strong fight-or-flight response.
Related to this need to flee from predators in the wild is an unusual trait:
horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down, with younger horses
tending to sleep significantly more than adults. Female horses, called mares,
carry their young for approximately 11&nbsp;months, and a young horse, called a
foal, can stand and run shortly following birth. Most domesticated horses begin
training under saddle or in harness between the ages of two and four. They reach
full adult development by age five, and have an average lifespan of between 25
and 30&nbsp;years.

Horse breeds are loosely divided into three categories based on general
temperament: spirited "hot bloods" with speed and endurance; "cold bloods", such
as draft horses and some ponies, suita
